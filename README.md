## Description 
This application focuses on building a weather dashboard that allows the user to search up a city name and then find out the live weather forecast for that day and the next five following days. The application also saves searched up cities and allows the information to be displayed unless the user clicks on the clear history button!

## Technologies Used
1. HTML 
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Moment.js
5. Open Weather API

# Challenges
This application required the time to be able to look up the open weather API documentation to figure out how the axios calls would work in retrieving the necessary data from the API calls. After using moment.js to figure that out, it was a lot simpler to utilize the code given.
